Small huddles are not energetically beneficial for small diurnal lizard Darevskia armeniaca

This repository contains the code and primary data for the paper "Small huddles are not energetically beneficial for small diurnal lizard Darevskia armeniaca"
Repository content:
1) **data.scv**: the main data frame, containing all the experimantal data
2) **CloacalSurface.csv**: the dataframe containing data for Fig. 1
3) **results_glmm.R**: an R code for the first part of the analysis, including GLMM and its validation, Fig.1-2, Fig.6 (Fig.SI2) and Table SI1
4) **results_series.R**: an R code for analysis of the series of consequent measurements, Fig.3-4 and Table SI2
5) **Lab_Temperature.R**: an R code for drawing Fig.5 (Fig.SI1)
6) All figures in .svg ang .tiff formats, except Fig.SI2.tiff, which is too lrge for the repo
7) **TableSI1.xlsx** and **TableSI2.xlsx** which are tables SI1 and SI2 respectively

All packages required to sucessfuly run the code are listed at the very begining of each .R file. **However, the code assumes that all the packages are alredy installed**. The code was developed with R 4.2.2
